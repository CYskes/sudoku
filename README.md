# Sudoku
This is a sudoku clone made with Dear IMGUI and SDL2.

This is something I have made to test and grow the knowledge I'm picking up as I go.  Feel free to take a look and suggest improvements. 
Currently the code is operational, but in no way clean.  I will be going through it to clean as I go, but the biggest push to organize 
will be once levels and players are properly implemented.

## To Do
- [ ] Isolate level one so it can be called from 'Run Sudoku' allowing future levels to be built
- [ ] Create a 'player' class to save game data/progress to
- [ ] Improve UI appearance
